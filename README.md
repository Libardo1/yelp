Yelp Funny/Useful/Cool
======

This repository hold code for analysis of the kaggle [yelp recruiting contest data](http://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recruiting/data). The goal of the contest was to predict the number of votes that a review would receive as 
'funny', 'useful', or 'cool' from yelp's users, thus allowing the site to promote reviews that are predicted to be popular without waiting for users to score them as such.  

The contest is long over, nor did we enter.  However, the data are useful to illustrate a variety of big data analysis issues, but are small enough for relatively fast estimation and experimentation.  In particular, this code was used in ['Distributed Multinomial Regression', Taddy (2013)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6139)

See the code/README.txt file for details on setup and execution.
